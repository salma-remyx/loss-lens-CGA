# Loss Lens

LossLens is a comprehensive visual analytics framework provides an interactive, multi-scale visual representation and analytical pipeline for exploring loss landscapes of
machine learning models.

## Run via Docker

To run the system through Docker, run the following under the root directory:

```
docker-compose up
```

Then, you should be able to launch the system via `localhost:3000`.

## Run Locally

Running locally needs a bit more step. Before installing the LossLens, make sure you have [Nodejs](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-22-04), [Python](https://www.python.org), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) installed first. Version requirements:

| Software | Min. Version |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Nodejs   | 18.0         |
| Python   | 3.8          |
| MongoDB  | 6.0          |

**Install GUI Dependencies**

Under the `gui` folder, run

```bash
npm install
```

to install all dependencies.

**Install Back-end Dependencies**

Under the `api` folder, run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/fra31/auto-attack
pip install git+https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench.git
```

to install all dependencies.

**Restore the Data on Local Machine**

Under the `database` folder, run

```bash
mongorestore --host mongodb --port 27017 --db losslensdb ./losslensdb/
```

**Run LossLens**

Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

to start the frontend server.

Run

```bash
python server.py
```

to start the backend server.

This project highly recommand committers to sign their code using the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) for each git commit but this is not required.

## Basin topology analysis

`server/calculate/script_util/basin_topology.py` derives basin depth (persistence), volume (region size), width (region span), and a sharpness/concentration summary from the merge trees and persistence diagrams the TTK pipeline already emits. It reports a landscape-level narrow-basin vs. flat-plateau regime score that can be correlated with a dataset's class-imbalance ratio. The descriptors are attached to each model's merge-tree record during ingestion (see `attach_basin_descriptors` in `read_csv_to_db.py`).
